***PHP class for the iubenda cookie law solution***

If you have European users you need to obtain and manage consent for the use of most cookies.
The iubenda Cookie Solution is an all-in-one approach developed by iubenda, that helps to make your website GDPR and Cookie Law compliant by integrating with your cookie policy, providing a compliant cookie banner and the blocking management of cookie scripts. The Cookie Solution also allows users to set advertising preferences on-site and within the solution, facilitated the recent-but-widely adopted IAB Europe Transparency & Consent [framework](https://www.iubenda.com/en/help/7440#aboutIAB).

[Read more about the Cookie Solution here](https://www.iubenda.com/en/features#cookie-solution).

#### This class allows you to scan a page in PHP for scripts and run the automatic blocking of scripts

*This is the class on which our WordPress and Joomla! and Drupal plugins are based and you can use it to build your own plugin independently for a platform other than those for which we have already developed a dedicated solution.*

* * *

## Functionality

This class works with the iubenda Cookie Law Solution and allows you to block the most common widgets and third-party cookies to comply with Cookie Law.

The class is currently able to detect and automatically block the following scripts:

* Google Analytics
* Google Maps
* Google AdSense
* Google ReCaptcha
* Google Site Search
* Google Tag Manager
* Google oAuth
* Google+ widgets
* Twitter widgets
* Facebook widgets
* Facebook Comments
* YouTube
* Vimeo
* Linkedin widgets
* ShareThis widgets
* Instagram widgets
* AddThis widgets
* Pinterest widgets
* PayPal widgets
* Disqus
* Optimizely
* Neodata
* Criteo
* Outbrain
* Headway
* Codepen
* Freshchat
* Uservoice
* AdRoll
* Olark
* Segment
* Kissmetrics
* Mixpanel
* Pingdom
* Bing
* Elevio


It also allows the manual blocking of all other resources without direct intervention on the actual scripts. Read more about the [prior blocking functionality here](https://www.iubenda.com/en/help/1229-cookie-law-solution-preventing-code-execution-that-could-install-cookies).

Here is an example of the PHP class integration:
```php
function iubenda_system( $html, $type = 'page' ) {
	if ( empty( $html ) )
		return;

	require_once( 'iubenda.class.php' );

	// separator
	if ( ! iubendaParser::consent_given() && ! iubendaParser::bot_detected() ) {
		$iubenda = new iubendaParser( $html, array( 'type' => in_array( $type, array( 'page', 'faster' ), true ) ? $type : 'page' ) );
		$html = $iubenda->parse();
	}

	// finished
	return $html;
}
```

The `iubenda_system` method verifies if the page visitor consents to the use of cookies. If they have consented, the script returns the HTML provided as a parameter without taking any action such as parsing/replacing.
Simply copy your method into the PHP document and then call it with the following syntax `iubenda_system("contenutohtml");` that will return the code.

* Parsing/replacing the portions of code contained within `<!--IUB-COOKIE-BLOCK-START-->` and `<!--IUB-COOKIE-BLOCK-END-->`
* Automatic parsing/replacing of iframe that contain defined src
* Automatic parsing/replacing of scripts that contain defined src

These operations take place in accordance with the rules explained in [this guide](https://www.iubenda.com/en/help/posts/1229). We suggest that you consult the posts relating to the alteration of script, img and iframe tags.
